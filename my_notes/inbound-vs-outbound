💡 Inbound vs. Outbound Rules in AWS — Explained Like Road Traffic 🚦

When you launch an AWS resource (like an EC2 server), you attach a security group. Think of this security group as a virtual firewall controlling the “traffic” coming in and going out of your server.

Here’s the simplest way to see it:

🚗 Inbound Rules = Incoming Traffic (Visitors Coming In)
 Imagine your server is your house. Inbound rules decide who can enter through your door and on which doorbell they can ring.
🔹 Example: Allow port 80 (HTTP) from anywhere → anyone on the internet can visit your website.
🔹 Example: Allow port 22 (SSH) from your office IP only → only you can remotely log in.

🚚 Outbound Rules = Outgoing Traffic (You Going Out)
 This is like who you’re allowed to call or visit outside. Outbound rules decide what traffic your server can send to the internet or other servers.
🔹 Example: Allow all outbound → your server can download updates or call APIs.
🔹 Example: Restrict outbound to only a database IP → your server can talk only to that database.

🔑 Quick Takeaway
Inbound = Who can come in
Outbound = Where you can go
Keeping these rules tight improves security and reduces risk.
