🔹 Forward Proxy vs Reverse Proxy (Explained Simply)

If you’ve ever wondered how your data moves on the internet, proxies are like middlemen that pass information between you and the server. But there are two main types — Forward Proxy and Reverse Proxy — and their roles are very different.

🧑‍💻 Forward Proxy – “User’s Middleman”

Think of a forward proxy as a personal assistant you send to the market.

You (the client) ask the assistant (proxy) to buy something from a store (server).

The store never knows it’s you asking — it only sees your assistant.

The assistant can filter, hide your identity, or control what you’re allowed to buy.

Real-world use case: corporate networks where employees’ internet requests go through a proxy for security and filtering.

🏢 Reverse Proxy – “Server’s Middleman”

Now imagine a company reception desk. Visitors (clients) come in and talk to the receptionist (reverse proxy), not directly to the employees inside (servers).

The receptionist checks who you are, routes you to the right department, and sometimes even caches brochures so you get them faster.

You (the client) don’t see which employee actually does the work — you only deal with the receptionist.

Real-world use case: large websites (like Amazon, Netflix) use reverse proxies for load balancing, security, and hiding their internal server structure.
